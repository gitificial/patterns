# Double buffering

Double buffering is a technique used in embedded systems and computer graphics to improve performance, ensure smooth operations, and avoid glitches or flickering during data processing or rendering. It involves using two memory buffers: one for ongoing operations (e.g., data processing, rendering) and another for data presentation or transfer.

This approach ensures that one buffer is always available for new data while the other is being consumed or displayed.

## How Double Buffering Works
1. Two Buffers:

* Front Buffer: The buffer currently being displayed, transmitted, or used for output.
* Back Buffer: The buffer currently being written to, updated, or processed in the background.

2. Switching Buffers:

* Once the back buffer is fully updated, the two buffers are swapped (or the pointers to the buffers are switched). The back buffer becomes the front buffer, and vice versa.

3. Seamless Transition:

* The swap typically happens during a safe period, such as a vertical blanking interval in displays or at the end of a processing cycle in data systems, ensuring no intermediate or incomplete data is presented.

## Applications of Double Buffering
1. Graphics Rendering:

* In graphical displays, double buffering avoids flickering by ensuring the display only shows fully rendered frames. While the back buffer is being updated with the next frame, the front buffer displays the current frame.

2. Audio Processing:

* In audio systems, double buffering ensures continuous playback without interruptions by preparing the next chunk of audio data in the back buffer while the front buffer is being played.

3. Data Acquisition:

* In systems like ADC (Analog-to-Digital Conversion), double buffering allows one buffer to be filled with new samples while the other is processed or transmitted.

4. Communication Systems:

* In UART or SPI-based systems, double buffering ensures efficient and uninterrupted data transfer.

## Advantages of Double Buffering
1. Smooth Output:

* Eliminates visual artifacts (e.g., flickering) or audible glitches by ensuring only complete data is presented.

2. Concurrency:

* Allows simultaneous operations: one buffer can be read while the other is written.

3. Efficiency:

* Minimizes delays by overlapping data production and consumption.

4. Real-Time Responsiveness:

* Ensures continuous data flow in real-time systems by decoupling data processing from data presentation.

## Disadvantages of Double Buffering
1. Increased Memory Usage:

* Requires twice the memory compared to single buffering, which can be a concern in resource-constrained embedded systems.

2. Complexity:

* Introduces additional complexity in buffer management, requiring careful synchronization between producer and consumer.

3. Latency:

* May introduce a slight delay (one buffer cycle) between data production and presentation, depending on the application.

## Key Steps in the Example
1. Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):

* The ISR fills the active buffer with ADC values. When the buffer is full, it swaps the active and processing buffers.

2. Processing Function:

* The main loop or task processes the data in the processing buffer while the active buffer is being filled by the ISR.

3. Synchronization:

* The buffer_ready flag ensures that the processing function only accesses the processing buffer when it's safe.
