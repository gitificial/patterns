# Device Driver Pattern

A Device Driver Pattern in embedded systems abstracts hardware access by encapsulating the hardware-specific operations in a driver. This makes the system more modular, portable, and maintainable. Below is an example of a Device Driver Pattern for an I2C Temperature Sensor in C.

## Example: I2C Temperature Sensor Driver
Scenario:
The hardware consists of an I2C-based temperature sensor.
The driver abstracts the low-level I2C communication, providing high-level APIs to the application.

## Explanation

1. High-Level Driver (temp_sensor.c):

- Abstracts hardware-specific details of the temperature sensor.
- Provides a simple API (temp_sensor_init, temp_sensor_read_temperature) to the application.

2. Low-Level Driver (i2c_driver.c):

- Handles the low-level I2C communication.
- Provides generic APIs (i2c_init, i2c_read, i2c_write) for interacting with any I2C device.

3. Application (main.c):

- Uses the high-level driver without worrying about the hardware details.
- Calls the driver API to read the temperature.

4. Modularity:

- The application and driver are decoupled. If the sensor changes, only the driver needs to be updated.

5. Simulation:

- For simplicity, the I2C driver simulates hardware interactions using printf. Replace these with actual hardware-specific code (e.g., STM32 HAL or Zephyr APIs).

## Benefits of the Device Driver Pattern
1. Encapsulation:

- Hardware-specific details are hidden from the application.

2. Reusability:

- The driver can be reused across different applications.

3. Portability:

- By changing the low-level driver (e.g., replacing simulated I2C with STM32 HAL), the same high-level driver can work on different platforms.

4. Maintainability:

- Changes in hardware only affect the driver, not the application.
