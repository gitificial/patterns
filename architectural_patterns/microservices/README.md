# Microservices pattern


## Advantages
| **Advantage**                          | **Description**                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Scalability**                     | Each service can be scaled independently based on load or resource needs.            |
| **2. Flexibility in Technology Stack** | Different services can be written in different languages or frameworks.              |
| **3. Improved Fault Isolation**        | A failure in one service typically wonâ€™t crash the entire system.                    |
| **4. Easier Deployment**               | Services can be deployed independently without affecting others.                     |
| **5. Better Maintainability**          | Codebases are smaller, making them easier to understand and modify.                  |
| **6. Faster Development Cycles**       | Teams can work in parallel on different services, accelerating delivery.             |
| **7. Reusability**                     | Services can be reused across projects or in other parts of the system.              |
| **8. Enhanced DevOps Practices**       | Fits well with CI/CD pipelines, containers, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. |
| **9. Domain-Driven Design Friendly**   | Each service maps well to a business domain or bounded context.                      |
| **10. Granular Security Controls**     | Fine-grained security policies can be applied per service.                           |
| **11. Clear Service Boundaries**       | Encourages strong API design and interface clarity.                                  |
| **12. Easier Testing in Isolation**    | Services can be tested and mocked independently of the whole system.                 |
| **13. Organizational Alignment**       | Teams can own specific services, aligning with company structure.                    |
| **14. Incremental Migration**          | You can refactor a monolith into microservices gradually, service by service.        |



## Disadvantages

| **Disadvantage**                           | **Description**                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Increased Complexity**                | More moving parts: services, APIs, databases, deployments, monitoring, etc.             |
| **2. Deployment Overhead**                 | Managing, versioning, and deploying many services is more complex than one app.         |
| **3. Distributed System Challenges**       | Network failures, latency, retries, and partial outages require careful handling.       |
| **4. Debugging and Tracing Are Harder**    | Tracing bugs across service boundaries is more difficult and requires tooling.          |
| **5. Data Consistency Is Hard**            | Transactions across services (ACID) require eventual consistency or saga patterns.      |
| **6. DevOps Demands Increase**             | CI/CD, observability, load balancing, and security for each service must be maintained. |
| **7. Testing Is More Complex**             | Integration and end-to-end testing must account for service dependencies.               |
| **8. Higher Latency**                      | More HTTP/gRPC calls add overhead vs in-process function calls.                         |
| **9. Cost of Inter-Service Communication** | Serialization, deserialization, and network use can be inefficient.                     |
| **10. Initial Setup Effort**               | Designing service boundaries and infrastructure is not trivial.                         |
| **11. Tooling and Governance Required**    | Requires solid infrastructure for logs, metrics, and service discovery.                 |
| **12. Risk of Over-Modularization**        | Too many tiny services can be harder to manage than a well-structured monolith.         |
